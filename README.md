🏦 U.S. Small Business Administration Loan Risk Prediction & Clustering Dashboard

 🚀 Overview

This project analyzes the **SBA (Small Business Administration) Loan dataset** to uncover patterns in loan approvals, identify high-risk borrowers, and build a predictive model to classify loan default risk.  
It combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering**, **Machine Learning (K-Means & Logistic Regression)**, and **Tableau Visualization** for clear business insights.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**
To help lenders and financial institutions:
- Identify **high-risk loans** before approval.
- Understand **key factors influencing defaults**.
- Visualize patterns and risk segments through an interactive dashboard.

## 🧠 **Key Features**
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — handled missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis — visualized relationships between loan amount, term, and default rate  
✅ Feature Engineering — encoded categorical columns, normalized numeric values  
✅ K-Means Clustering — segmented borrowers into low, medium, and high-risk clusters  
✅ Logistic Regression — built a predictive model to classify loan default probability  
✅ Tableau Dashboard — created interactive visuals for cluster trends, regional insights, and risk profiles  
✅ Model Evaluation — compared cluster metrics and model accuracy using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
